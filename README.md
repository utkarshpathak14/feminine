## Problem Statement

```http
  “Healthcare accessibility isn’t a privilege to women
             - it is a basic need and should be a priority”
```

Nowadays women are at par with men in all spheres of life, they are working as
successful doctors, engineers, professionals, entrepreneurs etc. Women do not feel free
to talk about their health. In some cases it becomes life-threatening. Talking about
women related health issues is still a big taboo in most parts of India.

For that, I am introducing an online friendly & intelligent healthcare assistant for women (sheBot). `It is smart enough to know all about the women health and health issues`. It also holds the potential to suggest correct `medication suggestions` and `home remedies` if required. Any woman can use it without any fear of getting judged.

`I respect data privacy, hence no data related to users or their queries is getting stored, so feel free to use it without any hesitation.`

Even you can make sheBot your best friend and talk about anything you want to reduce your mental stress.
